The "UniProt_PPI_List__without_nonhuman_entries.csv" file contains a list of all human protein protein interactions (PPIs) adopted from UniProt, release of April 22, 2020. Please note that the last three PPIs are added from the PICKLE database to draw the protein network of "Ovarian cancer-related tumor marker CA125" protein (Entry: Q8WXI7). In <a href="https://github.com/synaptic-proteolab/CAIR_EMIP/tree/master/Figures/Supplementary_Figure2_reduced.jpg">Supplementary Figure 2</a>, when networks are drawn using PICKLE interactions, higher number of interactions compared with UniProt database prevents details. The figure is then literary all black with interaction edges. That is the reason the UniProt interactions were used for Supplementary Figure 2. Nonetheless, in the case of Q8WXI7, because UniProt had not reported any interactions, three Q8WXI7 interactions were added from PICKLE database (see the end of the list).
